    Alright, so the title of this post is a little dramatic, but if you've ever been kept from doing something that you really enjoy because you are sick, you'll understand. oh yea, I also stole it from the title of one of my favorite bands.<br>

    I'm working on projects from home today so I don't irritate the crap out of everyone at bootcamp with my coughing, I'd much rather be there --It has been the highlight of my summer -- but my body is tell me it just...can't...do...it....today. So instead, I will be telling you a little bit about some very important things that I have learned.<br>

    For one, coding isn't a race, it's a team effort.
    Second, we all have the capacity to learn difficult concepts and new technologies, but some of us learn certain concepts and code faster while other concepts are a real struggle. Persistance is the key. Never give up!
    Three, stop comparing yourself to other coders. Bootcamp is not a competition and there is the right employer out there for each of us. The trick is to find the employer that allows to continue learning.
